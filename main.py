# Music Discover by Qi

## Motivation
To dig out more music, I would parse my current library songs into three categories:
    1. singer
    2. composer
    3. arranger
Then find out all music made by those people.

## Action Items
1. Parse Youtube Music Library into a dictionary with song name and singer name;
2. Save song name and singer name into database;
3. Search on the Internet with the identifiers(song name and singer name);
4. Parse and get the composer and arranger;
5. Save composer and arranger into database;
6. Search on the Internet for songs with singers, composers and arrangers;
7. Listen and find out what you like;
